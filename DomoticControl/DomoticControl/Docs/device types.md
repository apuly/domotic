# Device types

For every type of device (be it water pump, waterlevel sensor, etc.) a unique ID has been assigned.
Here, the different IDs and their assigned device type is described

## Ground water level sensor
ID: 0  

Ground water level sensors sense the amount of water present in soil.
This can be used to detect wether or not a plant needs extra water.

## Water pump
ID: 1

Water pumps are simply pumps that move water from one place to another.
This can for instance be used to water plants whenever the ground water level sensor detects that the plant needs water.
